And I feel that time's a-wasting, go<br>
So where ya going to tomorrow?<br>
And I see that these are lies to come<br>
So would you even care?<br>
And I feel it<br>
And I feel it<br>
Where ya going for tomorrow?<br>
Where ya goin' with the mask I found<br>
And I feel, and I feel<br>
When the dogs begin to smell her<br>
Will she smell alone?<br>
And I feel, so much depends on the weather<br>
So is it raining in your bedroom?<br>
And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray<br>
Would you even care?<br>
And I feel it<br>
And she feels it<br>
Where ya going for tomorrow?<br>
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?<br>
And I feel, and I feel<br>
When the dogs begin to smell her<br>
Will she smell alone?<br>
When the dogs do find her<br>
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
When the dogs do find her<br>
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
Where ya going for tomorrow?<br>
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?<br>
And I feel, and I feel<br>
When the dogs begin to smell her<br>
Will she smell alone?<br>
When the dogs do find her<br>
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
When the dogs do find her<br>
Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
To find it<br>
