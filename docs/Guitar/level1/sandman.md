Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son<br>
To include everyone<br>
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin<br>
'Til the Sandman, he comes<br>
Sleep with one eye open<br>
Gripping your pillow tight<br>
Exit light<br>
Enter night<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to never-never land<br>
Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight<br>
And they aren't of Snow White<br>
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire<br>
And of things that will bite, yeah<br>
Sleep with one eye open<br>
Gripping your pillow tight<br>
Exit light<br>
Enter night<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to never-never land<br>
Yeah-yeah<br>
Now, I lay me down to sleep (now, I lay me down to sleep)<br>
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (pray the Lord my soul to keep)<br>
If I die before I wake (if I die before I wake)<br>
Pray the Lord my soul to take (pray the Lord my soul to take)<br>
Hush, little baby, don't say a word<br>
And never mind that noise you heard<br>
It's just the beast under your bed<br>
In your closet, in your head<br>
Exit light<br>
Enter night<br>
Grain of sand<br>
Exit light<br>
Enter night<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to never-never land (yeah)<br>
Oh! Yeah-yeah, no<br>
We're off to never-never land<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to never-never land<br>
Take my hand<br>
We're off to never-never land<br>
We're off to never-never land<br>
We're off to never-never land<br>
We're off to never-never land<br>
