We don't need no education<br>
We don't need no thought control<br>
No dark sarcasm in the classroom<br>
Teacher, leave them kids alone<br>
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone<br>

All in all, you're just another brick in the wall<br>
We don't need no education<br>
We don't need no thought control<br>
No dark sarcasm in the classroom<br>
Teachers, leave them kids alone<br>
Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone<br>
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall<br>
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall<br>
