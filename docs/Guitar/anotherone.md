Let's go<br>
Steve walks warily down the street<br>
With his brim pulled way down low<br>
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet<br>
Machine guns ready to go<br>
Are you ready hey are you ready for this?<br>
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?<br>
Out of the doorway the bullets rip<br>
To the sound of the beat yeah<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
And another one gone and another one gone<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Hey I'm gonna get you too<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
How do you think I'm going to get along<br>
Without you when you're gone<br>
You took me for everything that I had<br>
And kicked me out on my own<br>
Are you happy are you satisfied?<br>
How long can you stand the heat<br>
Out of the doorway the bullets rip<br>
To the sound of the beat look out<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
And another one gone and another one gone<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Hey I'm gonna get you too<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Hey<br>
Oh take it - Bite the dust bite the dust<br>
Hey Another one bites the dust<br>
Another one bites the dust ow<br>
Another one bites the dust he he<br>
Another one bites the dust haaaa<br>
Ooh shoot out<br>
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man<br>
And bring him to the ground<br>
You can beat him<br>
You can cheat him<br>
You can treat him bad and leave him<br>
When he's down<br>
But I'm ready yes I'm ready for you<br>
I'm standing on my own two feet<br>
Out of the doorway the bullets rip<br>
Repeating to the sound of the beat<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
And another one gone and another one gone<br>
Another one bites the dust yeah<br>
Hey I'm gonna get you too<br>
Another one bites the dust<br>
Shoot out<br>
