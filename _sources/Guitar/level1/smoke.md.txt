Rylics:<br>
We all came out to Montreux<br>
On the Lake Geneva shoreline<br>
To make records with a mobile, yeah<br>
We didn't have much time now<br>
Frank Zappa and the Mothers<br>
Were at the best place around<br>
But some stupid with a flare gun<br>
Burned the place to the ground<br>
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky<br>
(Smoke) on the water, you guys are great<br>
They burned down the gambling house<br>
It died with an awful sound<br>
Funky Claude was running in and out<br>
He was pulling kids out the ground now<br>
When it all was over<br>
Find another place<br>
Swiss time was running out<br>
It seemed that we would lose the race<br>
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky<br>
Smoke on the water<br>
Burn it down<br>
We ended up at the Grand Hotel<br>
It was empty, cold and bare<br>
The Rolling truck Stones thing just outside<br>
Huh, making our music there now<br>
With a few red lights and a few old beds<br>
We made a place to sweat<br>
No matter what we get out of this<br>
I know, I know we'll never forget<br>
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky<br>
Smoke on the water<br>
(I can't hear anything)<br>
one more time<br>
(Smoke on the water) hey!<br>
