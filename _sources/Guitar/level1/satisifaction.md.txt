I can't get no satisfaction<br>
I can't get no satisfaction<br>
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try<br>
I can't get no, I can't get no<br>
When I'm driving in my car<br>
When a man come on the radio<br>
He's telling me more and more<br>
About some useless information<br>
Supposed to fire my imagination<br>
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey<br>
That's what I say<br>
I can't get no satisfaction<br>
I can't get no satisfaction<br>
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try<br>
I can't get no, I can't get no<br>
When I'm watchin' my TV<br>
And a man comes on and tells me<br>
How white my shirts can be<br>
But, he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke<br>
The same cigarettes as me<br>
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey<br>
That's what I say<br>
I can't get no satisfaction<br>
I can't get no girl reaction<br>
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try<br>
I can't get no, I can't get no<br>
When I'm ridin' 'round the world<br>
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that<br>
And I'm tryin' to make some girl, who tells me<br>
Baby, better come back maybe next week<br>
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak?<br>
I can't get no, oh, no, no, no, hey, hey, hey<br>
That's what I say<br>
I can't get no, I can't get no<br>
I can't get no satisfaction, no satisfaction<br>
No satisfaction, no satisfaction<br>
I can't get no<br>
