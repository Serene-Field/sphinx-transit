Rylics:<br>
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road<br>
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go<br>
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why<br>
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time<br>
It's something unpredictable<br>
But in the end, it's right<br>
I hope you had the time of your life<br>
So take the photographs and still frames in your mind<br>
Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time<br>
Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial<br>
For what it's worth, it was worth all the while<br>
It's something unpredictable<br>
But in the end, it's right<br>
I hope you had the time of your life<br>
It's something unpredictable<br>
But in the end, it's right<br>
I hope you had the time of your life<br>
It's something unpredictable<br>
But in the end, it's right<br>
I hope you had the time of your life<br>
