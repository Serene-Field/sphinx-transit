Rylics:<br>
Trudging slowly over wet sand<br>
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen<br>
This is the coastal town<br>
That they forgot to close down<br>
Armageddon, come Armageddon<br>
Come, Armageddon, come<br>
Everyday is like Sunday<br>
Everyday is silent and grey<br>
Hide on the promenade, etch a postcard<br>
"How I dearly wish I was not here"<br>
In the seaside town<br>
That they forgot to bomb<br>
Come, come, come, nuclear bomb<br>
Everyday is like Sunday<br>
Everyday is silent and grey<br>
Trudging back over pebbles and sand<br>
And a strange dust lands on your hands<br>
And on your face<br>
On your face<br>
On your face<br>
On your face<br>
Everyday is like Sunday<br>
"Win yourself a cheap tray"<br>
Share some greased tea with me<br>
Everyday is silent and grey<br>
