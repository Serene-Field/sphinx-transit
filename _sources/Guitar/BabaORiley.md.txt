Rylics:<br>
Out here in the fields<br>
I fight for my meals<br>
I get my back into my living.<br>
I don't need to fight<br>
To prove I'm right<br>
I don't need to be forgiven.<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Don't cry<br>
Don't raise your eye<br>
It's only teenage wasteland<br>
Sally, take my hand<br>
We'll travel south cross land<br>
Put out the fire<br>
And don't look past my shoulder.<br>
The exodus is here<br>
The happy ones are near<br>
Let's get together<br>
Before we get much older.<br>
Teenage wasteland<br>
It's only teenage wasteland.<br>
Teenage wasteland<br>
Oh, yeah<br>
Its only teenage wasteland<br>
They're all wasted!<br>
